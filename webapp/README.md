## Song File Format

Your song text file should follow this format:

```
# Amazing Grace

Amazing Grace, how sweet the sound
That saved a wretch like me

I once was lost, but now am found
Was blind, but now I see

# How Great Thou Art

O Lord my God, when I in awesome wonder
Consider all the worlds Thy hands have made
```

**Rules:**
- Start each song with `#` followed by the song title
- Separate verses/choruses with empty lines
- Each verse/chorus becomes a separate slide
- No special formatting needed - just plain text
